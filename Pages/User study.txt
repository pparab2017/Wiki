	 a) The node link will have users as the center and small nodes connected to them which will be user which edited 
	 	them, the edge length will be the mean difference between each consecutive edits. most of the vandalâ€™s users have a mean edit time of less the 15 minutes.
	 
	 b) If the pages have white border then they are not involved in a edit war by that user, but if they are black 
	 	then they are involved in wars most of the vandal users are involved in edit wars.
	 
	 c) If the name of the user is in black, then the user has edit a meta page. *Meta pages are the talk pages where 
	 	users will discuss the edits before editing any pages. most of the vandal users are not likely to edit an meta page.
